        Can create virtual audio devices using pulseaudio,
        by running the following commands:
            >$ pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=dynopii_sink sink_properties=device.description=dynopii 
            >$ pacmd load-module module-loopback source="dynopii.monitor" sink="dynopii"
            
        Now, we have virtual devices capable of being detected and selected by conferencing software such as Google meet
        (which is where I did all my testing)

        Now, on selecting our virtual device (namely "Monitor of dynopii" in this case) in our conferencing software,
        we are supposed to playback our desired output by selecting that in the playback tab in the pulseaudio window
        (pavucontrol). The playback of our script should have "dynopii" selected  as the device for it's "audiostream on"

        So, the only problem that remains solving is how to 

    Record Test Run : Jan 2, 1600 hours
        Situation : In a google meet with two devices (my phone and laptop), will be routing audio from my virtual device
        to my google meet.
        The endgoal is to make the scrip run a python program whose output I can then direct to the meet. 
        For this test, we will simply be routing the output of a sample audio file played using VLC.

        Step 1: 
            Load the dynopii null sink module using
            >$ pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=dynopii_sink sink_properties=device.description=dynopii 
            (this command seems enough)
        Step 2: 
            Set the microphone input device in the google meet to "monitor of dynopii"
        Step 3: 
            Play the desired audio, and in the "Playback" tab of the pavucontrol window, in front of the vlc thing,
            select "dynopii" (was already selected in my case, possibly because I had the same settings before restarting my laptop)
        
        And the audio can be heard in the meet.  
        // note : apparently, zoom will not detect such a monitor source. Use an echo-cancel for it instead.

    How to undo the script : 
        run command :   
            >$ pactl unload-module <module-number>
            This module number can be found using the command 
                >$ pactl list short modules
